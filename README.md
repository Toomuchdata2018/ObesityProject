# Obesity Project
 

## Summary

The purpose of this project was to use Pandas and Matplotlib to data mine any subject of our choosing.

Our group decided to use data found from [CDC's Annual Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/data_documentation/index.htm).

We focused on producing interesting-looking charts with Matplotlib that reflected Obesity rates against different factors available to us from the survey, particularly that of ethnicity, age, sex, education, and income.

## Tools Used

* Python 3
* Jupyter Notebook
* Microsoft Excel
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
